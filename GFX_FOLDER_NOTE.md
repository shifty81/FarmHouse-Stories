# Note About the GFX Folder

## Status: Awaiting Upload

The `gfx` folder that you mentioned has not yet been found in the repository. This note explains what to do once you upload it.

## When You Upload the GFX Folder

Once you add the `gfx` folder to the repository, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Quick Analysis

1. **Add and commit the folder:**
   ```bash
   git add gfx/
   git commit -m "Add graphics assets in gfx folder"
   git push
   ```

2. **Let me know** and I'll analyze it using the GFX Integration Guide

### Option 2: Manual Analysis

Follow the comprehensive guide in [docs/08_GFXIntegrationGuide.md](docs/08_GFXIntegrationGuide.md) which includes:
- Asset inventory and categorization
- Organization recommendations
- Import settings for Godot
- Cell shader testing
- Performance optimization

## What I'm Looking For

When the `gfx` folder is available, I'll analyze:

1. **Content Type:**
   - Character sprites (player, NPCs, animals)
   - Environment tiles and tilesets
   - Crops and plants
   - UI elements
   - Tools and objects
   - Effects and particles

2. **Technical Details:**
   - Image formats (PNG, JPG, etc.)
   - Dimensions and resolution
   - Organization structure
   - File sizes and optimization needs

3. **Integration Plan:**
   - Where to place files in the project
   - How to configure Godot import settings
   - Which assets work well with cell shading
   - Any modifications needed

4. **Licensing:**
   - Whether assets are original or third-party
   - What attribution is needed
   - License compatibility

## Alternative: Describe What's in the Folder

If you can't upload the folder directly, you can tell me:
- What types of graphics are included
- How they're organized
- The intended use for each asset type
- Any specific questions about integration

## Prepared Documentation

I've already created complete documentation that's ready to use with your graphics:

- **[05_AssetOrganization.md](docs/05_AssetOrganization.md)** - How to organize assets properly
- **[08_GFXIntegrationGuide.md](docs/08_GFXIntegrationGuide.md)** - Step-by-step integration workflow
- **[02_CellShadingTechniques.md](docs/02_CellShadingTechniques.md)** - How to apply shaders to your graphics

## Next Steps

1. **Upload the gfx folder** to the repository
2. **Push the changes** to GitHub
3. **Let me know** so I can analyze the contents
4. **I'll provide** specific recommendations for your assets

**Note:** This file can be deleted once the gfx folder is analyzed and integrated.
