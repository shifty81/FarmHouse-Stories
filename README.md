# FarmHouse Stories — Echoes of Aethelgard

A **2D top-down action-farming RPG** built with **Godot Engine 4.6**, merging **Link to the Past** puzzle-dungeons with **Stardew Valley** relationship mechanics. Set in **Aethelgard Valley**, players manage a farm, explore Zelda-style dungeons in the Echo Ridge mountains, tackle procedurally generated Mythic Rift dungeons for rare loot, and build relationships with 35 unique citizens of Hearthhaven.

## 🎮 Project Vision

- **Top-down 2D gameplay** with Zelda-like dungeon exploration and puzzle-solving
- **Cell-shaded graphics** for a unique artistic style
- **Deep farming mechanics** including crops, animals, and rift-touched seasons
- **Dual gear sets** — Farm Set for daily life, Dungeon Set for combat/spelunking
- **Link to the Past-style dungeons** with keys, puzzles, and boss battles
- **Mythic Rift dungeons** — procedurally generated challenges with Ethereal Token rewards
- **35 unique NPCs** with daily routines, rich backstories, and evolving questlines
- **Seasonal events** tied to US holidays with special creatures, drops, and activities
- **Resource management** through crafting and gathering

The game uses **cell shading** (toon shading) to create a distinctive, cartoon-like aesthetic:
- Distinct color bands instead of smooth gradients
- Clean outlines for definition
- Vibrant, hand-crafted appearance
- Optimized for 2D top-down perspective

See `docs/02_CellShadingTechniques.md` for implementation details.
